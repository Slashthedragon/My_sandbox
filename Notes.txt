I have just downloaded the zip file of this repository.
I unzipped it to a directory called git without the dot.
I am now writing this note.
I will save it in the directory which I just unzipped.
I will #git init to create a .git sub-directory.
I will # git add to put this and other files into the .git directory.
I will # git commit to make finalize those files.
I will # git push to put those files into the github server. 
I will go back to see what I did wrong.
I will need my directory name which is https://github.com/Slashthedragon/My_sandbox.git
I will need my user name.
I will need my password which is a pain in the ass.
Now time to save this and see what happens.

Well that didn't work.
