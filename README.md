My_sandbox
==========

This is my sandbox.

Things I should know.

http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics

Do this ...

$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext libz-dev libssl-dev

$ sudo apt-get autoremove


Because I already have Git on this computer I upgraded with 

$ git clone https://github.com/git/git.git

Changed the editor with 

$ git config --global core.editor emacs
